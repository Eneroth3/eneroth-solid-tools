If you want to contribute to Eneroth Solid Tools, please follow the following
guidelines.

* Create an Issue discussing a code change before making it. This way we will
know early on if your proposed change is in line with the intended direction of
the project, and how likely a pull request is going to be accepted.

* Keep coding style consistent. I can't stress how important this is for code
readability and reducing distractions when working. This project follows
[bbatsov's Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide),
with the modifications/clarifications defined in .rubocop.yml.

* Use [rubocop-sketchup](https://github.com/SketchUp/rubocop-sketchup) to verify
code style and best practises.

* Use [TestUp 2](https://github.com/SketchUp/testup-2) to test the code.

* Make all your changes in a separate branch, do a pull request and let the
maintainer merge into master only if deemed suitable.
